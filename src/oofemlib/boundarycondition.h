/**
 * Class implementing Dirichlet boundary condition on DOF (primary boundary condition).
 * This boundary condition is usually attribute of one or more degrees of freedom (DOF).
 *
 * The type of unknown (physical meaning)
 * is fully determined by corresponding DOF, to which given BC is
 * associated. The previous implementation uses the 'prescribedValueDictionary' to
 * store the unknowns types, but this makes sense, when BC is associated to node,
 * but when associated to BC, the physical meaning of unknown is determined by DOF.
 *
 * Boundary condition can change its value in time using its inherited TimeFunction.
 * It can also switch itself on or off depending on nonzero value of
 * isImposedTimeFunction load time function. Please note, that previous option must be
 * supported by particular engineering model (because equation renumbering is necessary,
 * and for incremental solution schemes DOFs unknown dictionaries must be used). See
 * particular engineering model documentation for details.
 *
 * The services provided include
 * - Returning a component, i.e., the prescribed value of an unknown
 *   (displacement, velocity, temperature, etc). Determined using
 *   ValueModeType (determines whether
 *   for example total value or its change from previous step is requested) - method give.
 * - Returning a value of isImposedTimeFunction, indicating whether b.c. is imposed or not
 *   in given time (nonzero indicates imposed BC) - method isImposed.
