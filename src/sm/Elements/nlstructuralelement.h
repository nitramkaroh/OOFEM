/**
 * Abstract base class for "structural" finite elements with geometrical nonlinearities.
 * The base class StructuralElement supports nonlinearities at constitutive level.
 * The new implementation of relevant services is extended to incorporate general geometric
 * nonlinearity. The services for computing nonlinear parts of geometrical equations for
 * particular strain components are provided. The updated services for stiffness,
 * strain and internal forces computations are formulated.
 *
 * The activation of non-linear effects can be generally controlled on element level
 * using nlGeometry, allowing elements to be used also in linear computations.
 * nlGeometry = 0 - Small strain theory based on the engineering stress and strain
 * nlGeometry = 1 - Finite deformation theory formulated in terms of the deformation gradient F
 *                  and first Piola-Kirchoff stress P in the virtual work
 *
 * @note
 * Methods ComputeStressVector and computeStrainVector as they are implemented here
 * assume Total Lagrange approach.
 *
 * Tasks :
 * - Defining itself
 * - Calculating its contribution to the problem:
 *   - calculating its mass matrix M, its stiffness matrix K, its load vector
 *     f, its location array ;
 *   - calculating its contribution to the LHS and RHS of the linear system,
 *     using Static, Newmark,etc, formula. These contributions are usually
 *     combinations of M,K,f.
 * - Performing end-of-step operations:
 *   - calculating the strains and stresses at its Gauss points ;
 *   - printing its output in the data file and updating itself ;
